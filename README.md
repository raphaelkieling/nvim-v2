# NVIM

Personal nvim with:
- Hop, for jump lines
- LSP with Mason + Mason LSP + CMP, for LSP stuff
- Conform, for formatting
- Trouble, to show issues on lines

## Recommendations for me at future

```sh
# Install ripgrep to be able to filter .gitignore on Telescope
brew install ripgrep

# Install the main languages
brew install nodejs
brew install golang
```
