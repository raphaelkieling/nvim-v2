# NVIM

Personal nvim with:
- Hop, for jump lines
- LSP with Mason + Mason LSP + CMP, for LSP stuff
- Conform, for formatting
- Trouble, to show issues on lines

## Recommendations for me at future

```sh
# Install ripgrep to be able to filter .gitignore on Telescope
brew install ripgrep

# Install the main languages
brew install nodejs
brew install golang
```

Download a nerdfont, recommended to be `FiraCode Nerd Font` in the (site)[https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads]. Remember to put in the terminal emulator that is the responsible to display the icons.
